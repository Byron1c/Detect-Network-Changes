# Detect Network Changes
Use the Detect Network Changes application to get alerted when the state of a network changes in Windows, rather than having to check the network icon in Windows.

You simply select the network you want to monitor, and if it disconnects or connects, changes IP Address, network ID, adapter ID, connection ID, Adapter name, or Network name, then you will be notified via a sound, notification and/or a popup.
