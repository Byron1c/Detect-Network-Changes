Post Installation Information

Please use the General tab to quickly configure Rest Relax Reminder (RRR) to your desired settings.

If choosing the PopUp reminder option, you may want to add a folder of pleasing images, so a random one can be displayed when the Rest Reminder appears.

There are a number of configuration options to tailor RRR to your preferences. Hold the cursor over any control, and a help window will appear, explaining what it does.

Once you have been using RRR for awhile, you can use the Stats tab to see how much you are resting on average etc.
